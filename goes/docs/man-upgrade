NAME
        upgrade - upgrade images

SYNOPSIS
        upgrade [-v VER] [-s SERVER[/dir]] [-r] [-l] [-t] [-a | -g -k -c] [-f]

DESCRIPTION
        The upgrade command updates firmware images.

        The default upgrade version is "LATEST".
        Or specify a version using "-v", form YYYYMMDD or vX.X

        The -l flag display version of selected server and version.

        The -r flag prints a report on current version numbers.

        Images are downloaded from "downloads.platinasystems.com",
        Or from a server using "-s" followed by a URL or IPv4 address.

        Upgrade proceeds only if the selected version number is newer,
        unless overridden with the "-f" force flag.

OPTIONS
        -v [VER]          version [YYYYMMDD] or LATEST (default)
        -s [SERVER[/dir]] IP4 or URL, default downloads.platinasystems.com
        -t                use TFTP instead of HTTP
        -l                display version of selected server and version
        -r                report current versions of goes, kernel, coreboot
        -g                upgrade goes
        -k                upgrade kernel
        -c                upgrade coreboot

invader> upgrade help
usage:  upgrade [-v VER] [-s SERVER[/dir]] [-r] [-l] [-t] [-a | -g -k -c] [-f]

note:
1) version(VER) is actually a directory under SERVER(url);
2) "sudo goes upgrade..." can be run directly.
